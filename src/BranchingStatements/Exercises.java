    Even or odd
    Given a sequence of natural numbers. Read numbers from the input, line by line,
    and for each number print if it is even or odd; if the number 0 is entered, don't print anything,
    immediately stop reading further numbers and terminate your program.

    Input data

    A sequence of natural numbers, each number in a new line.

    Output data

    The sequence of words "even" and "odd". Each word is in a new line.

    Output the result right after the number is entered. Then input the next one.
    There's no need to store the sequence.

    BUS TOUR
    A bus tour of Europe has been very successful. Due to an increase in the number of people who want to go on a tour,
    the tour company decided to increase the height of the bus. The new height of the bus is exactly N centimeters.

    But the tourâ€™s route runs under a lot of bridges, and there is a chance that the bus will crash into one of these
    bridges. Can you find out if this will happen?

    The first line of the input contains the height of the bus and the number of bridges under which the bus passes.
    The second line contains the heights of these bridges.

    You should output "Will not crash" if everything will be alright; otherwise,
    output "Will crash on bridge i" (where i is the number of the bridge) into which the bus will crash.
    If the height of a bridge equals the height of the bus, the bus will crash.
