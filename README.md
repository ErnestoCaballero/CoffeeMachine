# CoffeeMachine

Jetbrains is the company responsible for the IntelliJ Idea IDE as well as Pycharm. A few years ago it launch Jetbrains Academy, an attempt to provide future developers with all the knowledge, exercises and projects needed to become proficient programmers. This is the first project I enroll into its Java Developer Track.

# Learning outcomes

This project allows you to get a taste of Java. Challenge yourself with loops and conditions, practice working with classes, and get more confident in Java.

What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
